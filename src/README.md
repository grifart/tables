# Tables

Idea: make statically typed what is possible and prevent typos.

## Priorities:

- keep it simple (no-relations support)
- keep it fast to use (Scaffolding)
- do not write it twice (sync database to database-access-layer classes)
- do not screw up database - support for rich types as UUID, arrays, ... (easy to add more)
